Welcome to the Pre-Release of the Automatic Pool Allocator!

LICENSE:
========
Before using the Automatic Pool Allocator, you should read the pre-release
license in LICENSE.TXT.

BUILDING:
=========
To build the Automatic Pool Allocator, you will need to have installed and
compiled LLVM.

Once that is done, you can build the Automatic Pool Allocator using the
following steps:

	1. Run the configure script to tell the build system LLVM has been
	   installed.  Use the --with-llvmsrc=<dir> option to specify the
	   location of the LLVM source code, and use the --with-llvmobj=<dir>
	   option to specify the location of the LLVM object code.

	   For example, if the user joe with home directory of /usr/home/joe
	   has the LLVM source in /usr/home/joe/llvm, and it was configured
	   with ./configure --with-objroot=/tmp, then the Automatic Pool
	   Allocator should be configured with:

	   > ./configure --with-llvmsrc=/usr/home/joe/llvm \
	                 --with-llvmobj=/tmp/llvm

	2. Using GNU Make (sometimes called gmake), type "make" to build the
	   Automatic Pool Allocator:

	   > make

	3. To install the pool allocator bytecode libraries into the C front
	   end, use make with the install target:

	   > make install

USING THE POOL ALLOCATOR:
=========================
To use the Automatic Pool Allocator optimization pass, you will need to
explicitly load it into the opt program:

	> opt -load <path to pool allocator> -poolalloc <other opt options>

To link and run programs with the pool allocator, you will need to have the
poolalloc bytecode library in your LLVM_LIB_SEARCH_PATH.  If you have followed
the directions in the "Getting Started Guide" for LLVM, your
LLVM_LIB_SEARCH_PATH environment variable already points to the C front end's
directory of bytecode libraries.  Just use the install target (mentioned above)
of make to install the poolalloc library into that directory.

To link a bytecode file once it has been optimized, you can do the following:

	> llvmgcc -o <output file> <optimized bytecode file> -lpoolalloc

...where llvmgcc is an alias to the GCC C front end.

This will generate a bytecode file that can be executed.

CHANGES:
========
This pre-release has the following changes:

	- Correctly handles indirect calls
	- Correctly handles globals
	- Accepts partially pool allocatable programs
	- Fixed a large number of bugs
	- Tested on a number of benchmarks including Olden, Ptrdist, and a few
	  SPEC codes.
